Group Study Project - Ultibo Device - Jan 2018 Semester

Students are welcome to withdraw at any time. A minimal amount of personal information is collected (e.g. time zone in the table below).

Besides working with Ultibo, git and github will play a central role. The product will be one or more ultibo devices, as time permits. It is a group effort and work will be shared in ways that make sense for the individual students.

All work is public in the [study repository](https://github.com/markfirmware/ultibo-groupstudy-jan2018) and in the [Ultibo Forum](https://ultibo.org/forum/index.php).

This work will be completed by Friday, April 27, 2018.
